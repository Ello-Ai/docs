# **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**

Connect your assistant to dynamic tools through MCP servers for enhanced capabilities.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows your ello agent to dynamically access tools from MCP servers during calls. This enables your assistant to:

1. Connect to any MCP-compatible server
2. Access tools dynamically at runtime
3. Execute actions through the MCP server

This powerful integration allows your assistant to leverage a wide range of tools without requiring individual integrations for each service.

<Info>
  Ello AI also provides its own MCP server that exposes Ello AI APIs as callable tools. See the [**<u>Ello AI MCP Server documentation</u>**](https://docs.vapi.ai/sdk/mcp-server) to learn how to use it with Claude Desktop or custom applications.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you can use the MCP integration, you need to:

1. Have access to the Ello AI Dashboard
2. Have an agent created in Ello AI
3. Have access to an MCP server URL (e.g., from Make, Zapier, Composio, or other MCP providers)

## **Setup Steps**

### **1. Obtain MCP Server URL**

First, you need to obtain an MCP server URL from your chosen provider:

1. Sign up for an MCP-compatible service (e.g., Make, Zapier, Composio)
2. Navigate to the MCP configuration section of your provider
3. Generate or copy your MCP server URL

For Zapier MCP, visit [**<u>https://mcp.zapier.com/mcp/?client=vapi</u>**](https://mcp.zapier.com/mcp/?client=vapi)? to generate your MCP server URL. This URL should be treated as a credential and kept secure.

To generate your Make MCP Server URL (also known as MCP Token), navigate to your Make profile \> API Access tab \> Tokens \> Add token. See [**<u>Obtaining MCP Token documentation</u>**](https://developers.make.com/mcp-server/make-cloud-mcp-server/obtaining-mcp-token) for detailed instructions. This URL should be treated as a credential and kept secure.

### **2. Create and Configure MCP Tool**

After obtaining your MCP server URL, create and configure the tool:

1. `serverUrl`: The URL of your MCP server

The MCP server URL should be treated as a credential and kept secure. It will be used to authenticate requests to the MCP server.

### **3. Add Tool to Assistant**

Now, add the MCP tool to your assistant:

## **How MCP Works**

The MCP integration follows these steps during a call or chat session:

1. When a call or chat starts, Vapi connects to your configured MCP server using **Streamable HTTP** protocol by default, fetches the list of available tools, and dynamically adds them to your assistant’s available tools
2. The assistant can then use these tools during the interaction
3. **Each time the model invokes a specific MCP tool**, Ello creates a new connection to the MCP server and sends the request with the `X-Call-Id`/`X-Chat-Id` header to identify the call or chat
4. The MCP server executes the action and returns the result
5. This process repeats for every tool invocation, meaning **multiple MCP sessions are created per call or chat**

<Tip>
  Ello AI uses multiple MCP sessions throughout a single conversation to ensure consistent behavior across both calls and chat interactions. Each tool execution creates a separate connection to the MCP server, allowing for isolated and reliable tool execution. All tool invocations include the `X-Call-Id`/`X-Chat-Id` header to identify the specific call or chat.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The MCP tool itself is not meant to be invoked by the model. It serves as a configuration mechanism for Ello AI to fetch and inject the specific tool definitions from the MCP server into the model’s context.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The tools available through MCP are determined by your MCP server provider. Different providers may offer different sets of tools.
