## Quickstart

<Card>
  Follow these steps to go from zero to a production voice agent in minutes

  **1) Sign up & get credits**

  Start with a 3-day trial (example): you receive \$10 in credits to test voice agents.

  **2) Create an Agent**

  Open the visual conversation builder and choose a template (customer support, appointment booking, surveys).

  ```
  // Example: minimal agent config (JSON)
  {
    "name": "support-agent",
    "language": "en-US",
    "flow": [{"id":"greet","type":"message","text":"Hi — how can I help today?"}]
  }
  ```

  **3) Configure Integrations**

  Connect your CRM, calendar, or webhook endpoints. Use Zapier/n8n for no-code integrations or the MCP server for deeper integration.

  **4) Provision a Phone Number & Deploy**

  Provision a US number instantly or attach your SIP trunk for international numbers and click _Deploy_.

  ```
  # Deploy via CLI (example)
  curl -X POST "https://api.ello.ai/v1/agents"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"name":"support-agent","template":"support-basic"}'
  ```

  <Tip>
    AdaptivePrompt begins to analyze and improve after ~20–30 conversations and often shows measurable gains within the first 1–2 weeks.
