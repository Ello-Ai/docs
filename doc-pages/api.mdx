  Ello provides REST endpoints, webhooks, and an MCP server for deep integrations. Below are example calls to get you started.

  #### **Authentication**

  All requests require an API key via the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`.

  #### **Create Agent**

  ```
  POST /v1/agents
  Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY
  Content-Type: application/json
  
  {
    "name": "support-agent",
    "language": "en-US",
    "template": "support-basic"
  }
  ```

  #### **Deploy Agent**

  ```
  POST /v1/agents/{agent_id}/deploy
  Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY
  
  Response: { "status":"deploying","deploy_id":"..." }
  ```

  #### **Webhooks**

  Subscribe to events such as `call.started`, `call.ended`, `agent.evolution` via your webhook endpoint.

  #### **Realtime (MCP Server)**

  Use the MCP server for streaming call-level events and low-latency control. Contact support for SDKs and setup instructions.

  <Note>
    Example : simple curl to create an agent (mocked endpoint)
  </Note>
  ```
  curl -X POST "https://api.ello.ai/v1/agents"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"  
  ```
