  <h4>Core concept- AdaptivePrompt</h4>
  AdaptivePrompt is Ello's self-evolving engine. Instead of manual prompt engineering, AdaptivePrompt monitors live conversations, identifies failure patterns, and generates optimized instructions â€” effectively letting agents rewrite their own strategy over time.

  ### **How it works**

  - Multi-branch optimization creates parallel agent personalities specialized for different contexts.
  - Automated evaluation networks ensure only improvements that pass quality gates are adopted.
  - Administrators can set guardrails and perform rollbacks to previous stable versions.

  ### **Safety & Controls**

  AdaptivePrompt includes automatic auditing and human-review hooks. You can tune sensitivity, set automated rollback thresholds, and require manual approval for production changes.
