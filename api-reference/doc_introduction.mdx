## Introduction

<Card icon="sparkles">
  Ello is an enterprise-grade Voice AI platform that lets you create, deploy, and manage self-evolving conversational agents in minutes. Built for scale, reliability, and integration, Ello uses our proprietary **AdaptivePrompt** technology so agents continually improve themselves from real conversation data.

## Quickstart

<Card>
  Follow these steps to go from zero to a production voice agent in minutes

  **1) Sign up & get credits**

  Start with a 3-day trial (example): you receive \$10 in credits to test voice agents.

  **2) Create an Agent**

  Open the visual conversation builder and choose a template (customer support, appointment booking, surveys).

  ```
  // Example: minimal agent config (JSON)
  {
    "name": "support-agent",
    "language": "en-US",
    "flow": [{"id":"greet","type":"message","text":"Hi — how can I help today?"}]
  }
  ```

  **3) Configure Integrations**

  Connect your CRM, calendar, or webhook endpoints. Use Zapier/n8n for no-code integrations or the MCP server for deeper integration.

  **4) Provision a Phone Number & Deploy**

  Provision a US number instantly or attach your SIP trunk for international numbers and click _Deploy_.

  ```
  # Deploy via CLI (example)
  curl -X POST "https://api.ello.ai/v1/agents"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"name":"support-agent","template":"support-basic"}'
  ```

  <Tip>
    AdaptivePrompt begins to analyze and improve after ~20–30 conversations and often shows measurable gains within the first 1–2 weeks.

## Core Concept - AdaptivePrompt

<Card>
  AdaptivePrompt is Ello's self-evolving engine. Instead of manual prompt engineering, AdaptivePrompt monitors live conversations, identifies failure patterns, and generates optimized instructions — effectively letting agents rewrite their own strategy over time.

  ### **How it works**

  - Multi-branch optimization creates parallel agent personalities specialized for different contexts.
  - Automated evaluation networks ensure only improvements that pass quality gates are adopted.
  - Administrators can set guardrails and perform rollbacks to previous stable versions.

  ### **Safety & Controls**

  AdaptivePrompt includes automatic auditing and human-review hooks. You can tune sensitivity, set automated rollback thresholds, and require manual approval for production changes.

+ **StreamFlow**
Stream responses to TTS in real time to reduce latency and create natural conversational pacing.

+ **AutoTest**
Automated scenario testing and prompt evaluation to verify agent behavior before releasing to production.
## How Ello Ai works

Ello is the only platform with self-evolving voice agents. While competitors like Synthflow, Retell AI, and Vapi require constant manual optimization, our AdaptivePrompt technology automatically improves agent performance based on real conversation data. Your agents literally rewrite their own.
