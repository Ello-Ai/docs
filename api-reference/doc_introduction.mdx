## Quickstart

<Card>
  Follow these steps to go from zero to a production voice agent in minutes

  **1) Sign up & get credits**

  Start with a 3-day trial (example): you receive \$10 in credits to test voice agents.

  **2) Create an Agent**

  Open the visual conversation builder and choose a template (customer support, appointment booking, surveys).

  ```
  // Example: minimal agent config (JSON)
  {
    "name": "support-agent",
    "language": "en-US",
    "flow": [{"id":"greet","type":"message","text":"Hi — how can I help today?"}]
  }
  ```

  **3) Configure Integrations**

  Connect your CRM, calendar, or webhook endpoints. Use Zapier/n8n for no-code integrations or the MCP server for deeper integration.

  **4) Provision a Phone Number & Deploy**

  Provision a US number instantly or attach your SIP trunk for international numbers and click _Deploy_.

  ```
  # Deploy via CLI (example)
  curl -X POST "https://api.ello.ai/v1/agents"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $ELLO_API_KEY"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"name":"support-agent","template":"support-basic"}'
  ```

  <Tip>
    AdaptivePrompt begins to analyze and improve after ~20–30 conversations and often shows measurable gains within the first 1–2 weeks.

## Core Concept - AdaptivePrompt

<Card>
  AdaptivePrompt is Ello's self-evolving engine. Instead of manual prompt engineering, AdaptivePrompt monitors live conversations, identifies failure patterns, and generates optimized instructions — effectively letting agents rewrite their own strategy over time.

  ### **How it works**

  - Multi-branch optimization creates parallel agent personalities specialized for different contexts.
  - Automated evaluation networks ensure only improvements that pass quality gates are adopted.
  - Administrators can set guardrails and perform rollbacks to previous stable versions.

  ### **Safety & Controls**

  AdaptivePrompt includes automatic auditing and human-review hooks. You can tune sensitivity, set automated rollback thresholds, and require manual approval for production changes.

    #### **Model Switching**

    Route simple tasks to efficient models and reserve premium models for complex tasks to optimize cost / performance.
  </Card>
  <Card>
    #### **StreamFlow**

    Stream responses to TTS in real time to reduce latency and create natural conversational pacing.
  </Card>
  <Card>

## Deployment & Telephony

<Card>
  #### **Phone Numbers & SIP**

  Instant US number provisioning is available. For international numbers, attach your existing SIP trunk. Ello supports any SIP trunk provider globally.

  #### **Deployment Steps**

  1. Create agent with visual builder or API.
  2. Attach integrations and webhooks.
  3. Provision number or attach SIP trunk.
  4. Click "Deploy" and monitor real-time analytics.

  <Note>
    Note: Many customers are able to go live in under an hour for basic setups. Enterprise rollouts with extensive integrations typically take 1–2 weeks.
